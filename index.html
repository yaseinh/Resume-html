<h2 id="sum"><u><em>Summary</u></em></h2>
<p>With over a decade of experience in IT management, I have a proven track record of 
    leading teams and overseeing complex IT operations for major global events and leading 
    organisations. Most recently, I managed IT support during the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 
    where I coordinated resources and led teams to ensure seamless technological 
    operations, meeting the high demands of a globally watched event. I am highly skilled in 
    optimising IT service delivery, incident management, and collaborating with senior 
    stakeholders to drive continuous improvement. My expertise spans diverse industries, 
    allowing me to adapt quickly and deliver effective solutions in any environment.</p>
    <p>A key milestone in my career was working with the London Organising Committee of 
        the Olympic Games (LOCOG) as a Desktop Technician Engineer for the 2012 Olympic 
        Games. In this fast paced, high pressure environment, I provided mission critical IT 
        support, ensuring flawless service delivery for one of the world’s largest and most 
        intricate events.</p>
    <p>In addition to my roles supporting major events, I also held senior positions at British 
        American Tobacco, leading Desktop Support, AV and Tech Deck teams. I drove service 
        improvements, managed critical IT accounts, and handled technical escalations, working 
        closely with stakeholders to align IT services with corporate goals</p>
    <p>I have also worked with leading organisations like Morgan Stanley, Lloyds bank, BBC, 
        Serco, Red TV, and Barclay’s Capital, managing IT teams and implementing solutions 
        to enhance operations and productivity. My experience includes handling high-priority
        technical issues, leading system rollouts, and providing executive support across various 
        IT environments.</p>
